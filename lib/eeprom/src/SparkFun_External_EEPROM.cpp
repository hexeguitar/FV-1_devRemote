/*
  This is a library to read/write to external I2C EEPROMs.
  It uses the same template system found in the Arduino 
  EEPROM library so you can use the same get() and put() functions.

  https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_External_EEPROM_Arduino_Library
  Best used with the Qwiic EEPROM: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14764

  Various external EEPROMs have various interface specs
  (overall size, page size, write times, etc). This library works with
  all types and allows the various settings to be set at runtime.

  All read and write restrictions associated with pages are taken care of.
  You can access the external memory as if it was contiguous.

  Development environment specifics:
  Arduino IDE 1.8.x

  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
